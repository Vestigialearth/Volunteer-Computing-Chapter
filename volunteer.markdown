Volunteer Computing
Abstract
[At its core, volunteer computing is using the processing power of various heterogeneous devices within a distributed system in order to finish tasks for a singular project; usually one that would otherwise be too large for a single corporation/entity to solve itself. While volunteer computing could potentially be used in a corporate atmosphere, it is generally applied to fields in need of further scholarly research, such as folding proteins in the medical field. This is because volunteer computing allows researchers high-throughput computing at a low cost to researchers. The most common home to this large-scale volunteer computing is known as the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing, or BOINC for short. While Volunteer Computing does have many benefits to research, it is not without its issues, such as volunteer drop-off, varied hardware, and lack of reliability.]

   I. How Volunteer Computing works
Volunteer computing works on a client-server architecture. Each project has to host a project server, which is responsible for keeping project data, as well as distributing said data to the clients. The typical life cycle of a client-server interaction goes as follows:
Project Server sends the Client instructions to be completed
Project Server sends the Client Applications and input files 
Client Computes the assigned task from the Project Server
Client Uploads the output file to the Project Server
Client Reports results to the Project server 
After a task is completed, the client will request more tasks from the server, and the server will appoint jobs to the client. Until the process is interrupted, either by failure or user quitting a task, this cycle will continue indefinitely.
[Conclusion]

   II. Benefits of Volunteer Computing
[ The benefits of volunteer computing are immense for the advancement of research; as previously mentioned, volunteer computing allows for high-throughput computing for a low cost to researchers. And with more than one billion computers in the world, there is more potential computing power in volunteer computing than any other type of computing. Additionally, for there to be such a massive interconnected web of processing power that only costs researchers servers and employees and the volunteers their internet connection and electricity, there is little justification to not utilize volunteer computing. ]

   III. Detriments of Volunteer Computing 
While there are indubitably reasons to implement volunteer computing for researchers, there are plenty of downsides to such a system that makes it not applicable to all corporations. One of the main downsides to volunteer computing is in fact volunteers; that is to say, if there is not a reason for volunteers to actively provide their processing power to a larger corporation, they will not. For research activities such as folding proteins to find a cure for Alzheimer’s, volunteers will come. However, when it comes to making a corporate entity more money, very few volunteers would allow access to their hardware. Additionally, volunteer drop-off is a very real issue when it comes to volunteer computing; This is because

However, when it comes to making a corporate entity more money, very few volunteers would allow access to their hardware. Additionally, volunteer drop-off is a very real issue when it comes to volunteer computing; This is because volunteers maintain the ability to turn off their computing devices at any given moment, and in such means that at any given day the total processing power may decrease. Another factor that follows the unreliability issue is the fact that all computational devices on the network have different amounts of processing power, which leads to tasks needing to be delegated between computers with different configurations, such as computers with discrete graphics or with octa-cores.
